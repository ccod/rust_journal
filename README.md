# Rust journal

I want to learn rust. This project is basically an open journal for those
efforts. I am taking some of the solutions from the data structures and
algorithms course I took at Udacity, and translating them into rust code.
Hopefully idiomatic rust code too, but that might come later.

_test_


Also happens to contain leetcode solutions, and some tests to verify.
leetcode profile: [here](https://leetcode.com/ccod/)

## Requirements
* To run the rust tests, you require rust 2018 edition
* to run the python code, you require Python 3

## How to run
For the rust solutions, from the root directory, run:
<br/>
`cargo test`
<br/>
For the python solutions, point python at each file, for example:
<br/>
`python python_solutions/a_star_search.py`
